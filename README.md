## Features

- Easy setup and configuration.
- Backend-agnostic design.
- Integration with primevue for stylish and responsive UI components.
- Integration with formkit for efficient form handling, including form generation, API calls, file uploads, loading/error states, and toast notifications on success.
- Integration with formkit-builder for advanced form options, such as headless submits, form factory, and helper components.
- Custom inputs, including permissions input and file upload input.
- Formkit plugins to enhance form functionality, such as showing abstract on required fields and scrolling to errors.

## Installation

To install Dash Kit, use npm:

```bash
npm install dash-kit
```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary components and styles in your project:

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import DashKit from "dash-kit";
import "dash-kit/dist/dash-kit.css";

Vue.use(DashKit);
```

2. Set up the main layout component as the parent route for your dashboard:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <router-view v-if="!$route.meta.requiresAuth || isLoggedIn" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    isLoggedIn() {
      // Implement your login check logic here
      return false;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

3. Import the login component inside the login view and pass the login endpoint as a prop:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <login-component :loginEndpoint="apiEndpoints.login" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import LoginComponent from "dash-kit";

export default {
  components: {
    LoginComponent,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      apiEndpoints: {
        login: "/api/login",
      },
    };
  },
};
</script>
```
